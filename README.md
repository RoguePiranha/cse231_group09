# Chess Program

Welcome to our Chess Program! This project was developed by Andrew Swayze, Collin Squires, and Dallin Olson as part of the CSE 231: Inheritance Design course.

## Overview

This program simulates a game of chess by providing a simple command-line interface for user input and implementing the logic for various chess pieces, their moves, and special rules (such as pawn promotion, en-passant, and castling). The program is designed using inheritance, which allows for easy expansion and modification of the code.

## Features

- Command-line interface for user input
- Object-oriented design using inheritance
- Implementation of chess rules:
  - Pawn promotion
  - En-passant
  - Castling
